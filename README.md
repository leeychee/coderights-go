Coder Rights Manifesto
============================================================

# Description

We need `955`, in other words `work life balance`, rather than `996.ICU`.

We should **fight** for this, just like workers have done 200+ years ago.

# Usage

Just import the pkg, will print a message in the console.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	_ "github.com/leeychee/coderights-go/work955"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Celebrate Coderights!")
}
```

# TODO

It's just a very simple prototype. Wish your mind.
